I’m an IT Security expert with a specialization in low level security and
malware reverse engineering.
I also work with containers (especially Kubernetes), as an administrator
and as a security specialist.
I have strong background in programming, and the widely understood IT security
in general.

My personal website is <a href="https://tailcall.net">https://tailcall.net</a>.

    <h4><b>Malware Reverse Engineering</b></h4>
    <p>I have many years of experience with Reverse Engineering (including
    consumer-grade malware and APT threats). Despite doing it professionally
    for a living, I still love RE and I'm ready to analyse any program you send
    me. Depending on your needs, I may write a detailed report from the analysis,
    extract the IoCs from provided samples, automate the extraction, or more.
    I also analyse things other than malware, but only for a good/ethical
    purposes.</p>

    <h4><b>Reverse Engineering training</b></h4>
    <p>An introduction to the fascinating world of reverse engineering.
    I'll share my knowledge of malware analysis with your group/company.
    Training will include real-world examples, hands-on exercises, and
    cutting-edge techniques that will empower you to analyse malicious code
    effectively. Both introductory and advanced courses offered. Course
    materials are updated all the time, so it's always up to date with the
    latest threats and techniques.</p>

    <h4><b>Kubernetes security workshops</b></h4>
    <p>Kubernetes security is a very complex and yet underexplored topic.
    It's very easy to make a mistake that will cause a compromise of the
    entire cluster. I believe I have a unique position to teach about securing
    Kubernetes, thanks to my strong focus on both IT security and
    containerisation techniques. Together with
    <a href="https://icedev.pl/">Michał Leszczyński</a> we offer Kubernetes
    security workshops that will teach you the secrets of Kubernetes
    administration, and share the best security practices in the process.
    Agenda is flexible depending on your needs: we have units about
    Kubernetes basics, Kubernetes architecture, securing deployed applications,
    generic cluster security, and even low-level cluster attacks. Both 1 day
    and 2 day workshops offered.</p>
